9977,"But Kashima's schedule is so crazy that I'm worried about player fatigue. It's kind of mean to let J play in between the two ACL finals matches_:(´_`” ∠): To be honest, even if I lost the match against Kashiwa... I can't say anything. It's impossible to go all out! ! I want everyone to adjust well and do their best without getting injured.",negative

9999,"I was wondering what would happen to the DF line after Ueda transferred and Masako left after the World Cup, but Seunghyun and Anzai's active performances were a complete miscalculation. I think Wanchan has had a lot of opportunities to play and has gained experience, Machi is promising, and there are Atsuto and Daigo on the right side. Kashima has a thick layer. But this winter, maybe Masako will transfer. Cry.",neutral
